<div class="faq-element question-bubble">How many characters are voiced in the mod?</div>
<div class="faq-element answer-bubble">
	<p>Currently, all quest NPCs and dungeon NPCs are voiced. We’re working hard to keep all quest and dungeon dialogues up to date while adding voicelines to other NPCs as well, but sometimes, there is is slight change in dialogue that breaks a voiceline here and there.</p>
	<p>In addition to quest and dungeon NPCs, we’ve also added full voice acting for the Seaskipper Captain and the Talking Mushroom. Other significant NPCs will be added soon!</p>

<div class="faq-element question-bubble">Do you plan to voice all NPCs in Wynncraft?</div>
<div class="faq-element answer-bubble">
	<p>We’re currently adding voices to Secret Discoveries and Boss Altars. After that, it is our hope that we will voice all NPCs with white name tags that players are most likely to talk to. It’s not likely we’ll manage to do every single one because of dialogue changes.</p>

<div class="faq-element question-bubble">What Minecraft version is needed for the mod to work?</div>
<div class="faq-element answer-bubble">
    <p>The mod is currently developed for Fabric (Minecraft version <b class="monospace">1.20.2</b>).</p>
    <p>In the past, it was first developed for Forge (Minecraft version <b class="monospace">1.12.2</b>), but support for Forge was dropped recently. You can still download the old versions on our <a href="/downloads">Downloads page</a>.</p>
	<p>Voices of Wynn is also compatible with Wynntils.</p>

<div class="faq-element question-bubble" id="data-processing">What user data does the mod collect and how are they processed?</div>
<div class="faq-element answer-bubble">
    <p>When you log in to Wynncraft with the mod enabled, it sends a request to our servers to check whether there's an update available and also to log some things for analytical purposes.</p>
    <p>The main information sent to our servers with this request is a <code>sha256</code> hash of your player UUID. This hash can never be turned back into your UUID and serves as an anonymous and unique identificator of a user.</p>
    <p>Because of how HTTP requests work, your IP (or IP of any VPN or Tor exit node used) is also visible to us. This information is also hashed using the same algorithm (server-side this time).</p>
    <p>These two pieces of information are stored securely in our database. The hash of your IP address is deleted after 2 days at most, the hash of your UUID is kept permanently, but after two days at most, the timestamp when it was submitted is deleted.</p>
    <p>This image probably does a better job at explaining the flow of the whole process:</p>
    <img src="images/data-processing.svg" />
    <p>In the end, we're left with the following statistics:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>How many players used our mod on any given day.</li>
        <li>The total number of unique players who used our mod at least once.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The hash of your UUID is kept to not count you into the second statistic more than once.</p>

<div class="faq-element question-bubble">Can I voice a character?</div>
<div class="faq-element answer-bubble">
	<p>Of course, we’d be more than happy to have another voice actor. Simply <a href="https://discord.gg/kuEK3XH4Y5" target="_blank">join our discord</a> and we’ll guide you from there.</p>

<div class="faq-element question-bubble">I think that a certain NPC’s voice doesn’t fit.</div>
<div class="faq-element answer-bubble">
	<p>We’re always appreciative of feedback. Some roles were cast early in the mod, when we had much lower standards for performances. One way to signal which NPCs need revoicing is to vote for the recordings in <a href="contents">Mod Contents</a>. Click the name of any NPC and navigate down to the recording of your choice. There, you can also leave comments with feedback for the voice actors. Keep in mind that, if you are not logged into the site, your IP address will be stored to prevent abuse.</p>

<div class="faq-element question-bubble">Some dialogue isn’t playing. Where can I report it?</div>
<div class="faq-element answer-bubble">
	<p>Be aware that some dialogue, especially dialogue said by most of the white-named NPCs (non-quest NPCs) is not voiced. However, all dialogue related to quests and dungeons should be voiced. If you enabled line reporting after installing Voices of Wynn, you don't need to do anything, because the reports will be sent automatically.</p>

<div class="faq-element question-bubble">I saw a login button. How can I create an account?</div>
<div class="faq-element answer-bubble">
	<p>The ability to create accounts is reserved for system administrators. Only contributors – voice actors, coders, or script writers – can have an account. If you apply and are picked for a role, then administrators will create an account for you.</p>
</div>
<hr class="hr-f">
<div class="faq-element question-bubble">I have an account, but forgot my password. There’s no “forgot password” button, so what do I do?</div>
<div class="faq-element answer-bubble">
	<p>If you forgot your password, contact <a href="https://discord.com/users/518828923186970646" target="_blank">@shady_medic</a> on Discord and explain. It’ll be easier if you contact him from the same account you used to apply to the project. Shady will reset your password.</p>
