# Voices Of Wynn Website
This repository stores code for the public website presenting the community project **Voices of Wynn** â€“ a mod for Minecraft that allows all players listen to NPC dialogue on the MMORPG server Wynncraft instead of reading it.


## For Developerts 
### Running the website locally
To run the website locally you need to make sure you have your Docker engine with docker-compose running. An easy way of doing this is downloading [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) and simply running the application. Once you have that simply run: 
```bash
docker-compose  -f .\docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```
this will create all the containers (databases and everything) for you.

This should make the website available at http://127.0.0.1


### Liquibase

We use liquibase as a database schema change management tool. It allows you to manage and track database schema changes in a version-controlled manner, making it easier to deploy and maintain database changes across different environments.

To change anything about the database structure you need to create a new changeset and add it at the bottom of the changelog found in the `liquibase` directory. The changset name should get a title such as:
`-- changeset <name>:<yourChangesetNum>` so if your name is kmaxi and this is the first change YOU are making it should look like this:
`-- changeset kmaxi:1`.

For more information on how to use Liquibase, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.liquibase.org/documentation/index.html).
