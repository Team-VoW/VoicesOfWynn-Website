# Voices Of Wynn Website

This repository stores code for the public website presenting the community project **Voices of Wynn** â€“ a mod for Minecraft that allows all players listen to NPC dialogue on the MMORPG server Wynncraft instead of reading it.

## For Developerts

### Running the website locally

To run the website locally you need to make sure you have your Docker engine with docker-compose running. An easy way of doing this is downloading [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) and simply running the application. Once you have that simply run:

```bash
docker-compose -f .\docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

if you are on linux, run

```bash
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

after having run it once you do not need to include the --build in future startups which will make starting it faster

this will create all the containers (databases and everything) for you.

This should make the website available at http://127.0.0.1

If you have some weird issues or want to reset everything do the command:

```bash
docker system prune -a --volumes
```

after which you will have to run the docker-compose command again with --build.

### Liquibase

We use liquibase as a database schema change management tool. It allows you to manage and track database schema changes in a version-controlled manner, making it easier to deploy and maintain database changes across different environments.

To change anything about the database structure you need to create a new changeset and add it at the bottom of the changelog found in the `liquibase` directory. The changset name should get a title such as:
`-- changeset <name>:<yourChangesetNum>` so if your name is kmaxi and this is the first change YOU are making it should look like this:
`-- changeset kmaxi:1`.

For more information on how to use Liquibase, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.liquibase.org/documentation/index.html).
